# Diffusion_CO2Emissions
Image and Tabular Diffusion Models and Calculations for Model Emissions

## Run Experiment:

1) Run *Generate_Dataset.ipynb* to build the datasets for tabular and image models

2) Run *Run_TabDDPM_Experiment.ipynb* to train and sample the suite of tabular diffusion models

3) Run *Run_ImgDDPM_Experiment.ipynb* to train and sample the suite of image diffusion models.
